rtapp-201710 v. 1.0.0 (released 2019-03-31)

    - bug fix: rtapp erroneously rejected MinOccupancy = 0 in Offers (ref.
      standard document PDF p. 58)

    - bug fix: rtapp did not handle the values SetForwardMinStay and
      SetForwardMaxStay for attribute MinMaxMessageType (ref. standard document
      PDF p. 50)

    - added feature: rtapp now honours the Min/MaxAdvancedBookingOffset attributes;
      the booking date can be given to cli.js with the new, optional -b argument
      (the default value is the current date)

    - forked from rtapp-201507 v. 1.3.0 and adapted to AlpineBits 2017-10
