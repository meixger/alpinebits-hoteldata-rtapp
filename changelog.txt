rtapp v. 2.0.0 (release 2020-11-22)

    - renamed from "rtapp-201710" to just "rtapp" to reflect the fact that this codebase
      supports all the latest versions of the standard since 2017-10 and not just
      2017-10 specifically

    - bug fix: rtapp 1.1.0 exited with "ReferenceError: protocol_version is not defined"
      when maximum child occupancy was given; the bug was reported and patched by Luca R.
     ( https://gitlab.com/alpinebits/hoteldata/rtapp/-/merge_requests/2 )

    - added feature: rtapp now also supports 2020-10: the -p option recognizes
      "2020-10"; in this version currencies codes can be different from "EUR"


rtapp-201710 v. 1.1.0 (released 2019-06-05)

    - added feature: besides AlpineBits 2017-10, rtapp-201710 can now also
      handle AlpineBits 2018-10; there is a new option:

      -p <protocol_version> is optional and can be either 2017-10 (the default) or 2018-10


rtapp-201710 v. 1.0.0 (released 2019-03-31)

    - bug fix: rtapp erroneously rejected MinOccupancy = 0 in Offers (ref.
      standard document PDF p. 58)

    - bug fix: rtapp did not handle the values SetForwardMinStay and
      SetForwardMaxStay for attribute MinMaxMessageType (ref. standard document
      PDF p. 50)

    - added feature: rtapp now honours the Min/MaxAdvancedBookingOffset attributes;
      the booking date can be given to cli.js with the new, optional -b argument
      (the default value is the current date)


rtapp-201710 v. 1.0.0-rc.1 (released 2018-03-26)

    - forked from rtapp-201507 v. 1.3.0 and adapted to AlpineBits 2017-10
